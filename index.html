<h1>End Quarantine Faster: Always Wear a Mask in Public</h1>
<p>
This site is intended to help encourage people to wear masks in public.
It is part of a greater movement to encourage a large portion of the population to put up signs and bumper stickers to get that message out.
We need to change the culture of in our country, and remove the stigma of masks.
Maybe this culture is already changing in some parts of the country, but in Houston, Texas, people are out at grocery stores without masks.
They need to feel social pressure to wear masks.

It will be months or years before there is a vaccine.
In order to be as back-to-normal as possible, the number one thing we can do is wear masks in public.
